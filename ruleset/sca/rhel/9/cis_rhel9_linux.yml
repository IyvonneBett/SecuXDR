    rationale: "Making /tmp its own file system allows an administrator to set additional mount options such as the noexec option on the mount, making /tmp useless for an attacker to install executable code.

Once the program was updated, the hard link would be broken and the attacker would have his own copy of the program. If the program happened to have a security vulnerability, the attacker could continue to exploit the known flaw. This can be accomplished by either mounting tmpfs to /tmp, or creating a separate partition for /tmp."

    description: "The /var directory is used by daemons and other system services to temporarily store dynamic data. Some directories created by these processes may be world-writable."
    rationale: "The reasoning for mounting /var on a separate partition is as follow. - Protection from resource exhaustion: The default installation only creates a single / partition. Since the /var directory may contain world-writable files and directories, there is a risk of resource exhaustion. It will essentially have the whole disk available to fill up and impact the system as a whole. In addition, other operations on the system could fill up the disk unrelated to /var and cause unintended behavior across the system as the disk is full. See man auditd.conf for details. - Fine grained control over the mount: Configuring /var as its own file system allows an administrator to set additional mount options such as noexec/nosuid/nodev. These options limit an attacker’s ability to create exploits on the system. Other options allow for specific behavior. See man mount for exact details regarding filesystem-independent and filesystem-specific options. - Protection from exploitation: An example of exploiting /var may be an attacker establishing a hard-link to a system setuid program and wait for it to be updated.

  - id: 28019
    title: "Ensure separate partition exists for /var/log/audit."
    description: "The auditing daemon, auditd, stores log data in the /var/log/audit directory."
    rationale: "The reasoning for mounting /var/log/audit on a separate partition is as follow. - Protection from resource exhaustion: The default installation only creates a single / partition. Since the /var directory may contain world-writable files and directories, there is a risk of resource exhaustion. It will essentially have the whole disk available to fill up and impact the system as a whole. In addition, other operations on the system could fill up the disk unrelated to /var and cause unintended behavior across the system as the disk is full. See man auditd.conf for details. - Fine grained control over the mount: Configuring /var as its own file system allows an administrator to set additional mount options such as noexec/nosuid/nodev. These options limit an attacker’s ability to create exploits on the system. Other options allow for specific behavior. See man mount for exact details regarding filesystem-independent and filesystem-specific options. - Protection from exploitation: An example of exploiting /var may be an attacker establishing a hard-link to a system setuid program and wait for it to be updated. Once the program was updated, the hard-link would be broken and the attacker would have his own copy of the program. If the program happened to have a security vulnerability, the attacker could continue to exploit the known flaw."

RPC processes notify rpcbind when they start, registering the ports they are listening on and the RPC program numbers they expect to serve. The client system then contacts rpcbind on the server with a particular RPC program number. The rpcbind service redirects the client to the proper port number so it can communicate with the requested service. Portmapper is an RPC service, which always listens on tcp and udp 111, and is used to map other RPC services (such as nfs, nlockmgr, quotad, mountd, etc.) to their corresponding port number on the server. When a remote host makes an RPC call to that server, it first consults with portmap to determine where the RPC server is listening."

    description: "In networking, source routing allows a sender to partially or fully specify the route packets take through a network. In contrast, non-source routed packets travel a path determined by routers in the network. In some cases, systems may not be routable or reachable from some locations (e.g. private addresses vs. Internet routable), and so source routed packets would need to be used."

Assume this system was capable of routing packets to Internet routable addresses on one interface and private addresses on another interface. Assume that the private addresses were not routable to the Internet routable addresses and vice versa. Under normal routing circumstances, an attacker from the Internet routable addresses could not use the system as a way to reach the private address systems.

    description: "When tcp_syncookies is set, the kernel will handle TCP SYN packets normally until the half-open connection queue is full, at which time, the SYN cookie functionality kicks in.

It provides firewall features by acting as a front-end for the Linux kernel's netfilter framework via the iptables backend or provides firewall features by acting as a front-end for the Linux kernel's netfilter framework via the nftables utility. firewalld replaces iptables as the default firewall management tool. Use the firewalld utility to configure a firewall for less complex firewalls. The utility is easy to use and covers the typical use cases scenario. FirewallD supports both IPv4 and IPv6 networks and can administer separate firewall zones with varying degrees of trust as defined in zone profiles. Note: Starting in v0.6.0, FirewallD added support for acting as a front-end for the Linux kernel's netfilter framework via the nftables userspace utility, acting as an alternative to the nft command line program."

    description: "Monitor the use of the mount system call. The mount (and umount) system call controls the mounting and unmounting of file systems. The parameters below configure the system to create an audit record when the mount system call is used by a non-privileged user."
    rationale: "It is highly unusual for a non-privileged user to mount file systems to the system. While tracking mount commands gives the system administrator evidence that external media may have been mounted (based on a review of the source of the mount and confirming it's an external media type), it does not conclusively indicate that data was exported to the media. System administrators who wish to determine if data were exported, would also have to track successful open, creat and truncate system calls requiring write access to a file under the mount point of the external media file system. This could give a fair indication that a write occurred. The only way to truly prove it, would be to track successful writes to the external media. Tracking write system calls could quickly fill up the audit log and is not recommended. Recommendations on configuration options to track data export to media is beyond the scope of this document."

The default is 0, indicating that these messages will not be sent to the client. - ClientAliveCountMax sets the number of client alive messages which may be sent without sshd receiving any messages back from the client. If this threshold is reached while client alive messages are being sent, sshd will disconnect the client, terminating the session. The default value is 3. o The client alive messages are sent through the encrypted channel o Setting ClientAliveCountMax to 0 disables connection termination Example: The default value is 3. If ClientAliveInterval is set to 15, and ClientAliveCountMax is left at the default, unresponsive SSH clients will be disconnected after approximately 45 seconds."
    rationale: "Having no timeout value associated with a connection could allow an unauthorized user access to another user's ssh session (e.g. user walks away from their computer and doesn't lock the screen).

    title: "Ensure sudo is installed."
    description: "sudo allows a permitted user to execute a command as the superuser or another user, as specified by the security policy. The invoking user's real (not effective) user ID is used to determine the user name with which to query the security policy."
    rationale: "sudo supports a plug-in architecture for security policies and input/output logging. Third parties can develop and distribute their own policy and I/O logging plug-ins to work seamlessly with the sudo front end. The default security policy is sudoers, which is configured via the file /etc/sudoers and any entries in /etc/sudoers.d. The security policy determines what privileges, if any, a user has to run sudo. The policy may require that users authenticate themselves with a password or another authentication mechanism. If authentication is required, sudo will exit if the user's password is not entered within a configurable time limit. This limit is policy-specific."

    rationale: "Restricting the use of su, and using sudo in its place, provides system administrators better control of the escalation of user privileges to execute privileged commands. The sudo utility also provides a better logging and audit mechanism, as it can log each command executed via sudo, whereas su can only record that a user executed the su program."

  # 5.6.5 Ensure default user umask is 027 or more restrictive (Automated)
  - id: 28199
    title: "Ensure default user umask is 027 or more restrictive."
    description: "The user file-creation mode mask (umask) is use to determine the file permission for newly created directories and files. In Linux, the default permissions for any newly created directory is 0777 (rwxrwxrwx), and for any newly created file it is 0666 (rw-rw-rw-). The umask modifies the default Linux permissions by restricting (masking) these permissions. The umask is not simply subtracted, but is processed bitwise. Bits set in the umask are cleared in the resulting file mode. umask can be set with either octal or Symbolic values: - Octal (Numeric) Value - Represented by either three or four digits. ie umask 0027 or umask 027. If a four digit umask is used, the first digit is ignored. The remaining three digits effect the resulting permissions for user, group, and world/other respectively. - Symbolic Value - Represented by a comma separated list for User u, group g, and world/other o. The permissions listed are not masked by umask. ie a umask set by umask u=rwx,g=rx,o= is the Symbolic equivalent of the Octal umask 027. This umask would set a newly created directory with file mode drwxr-x--- and a newly created file with file mode rw-r-----. The default umask can be set to use the pam_umask module or in a System Wide Shell Configuration File. The user creating the directories or files has the discretion of changing the permissions via the chmod command, or choosing a different default umask by adding the umask command into a User Shell Configuration File, ( .bash_profile or .bashrc), in their home directory. Setting the default umask: - pam_umask module: o will set the umask according to the system default in /etc/login.defs and user settings, solving the problem of different umask settings with different shells, display managers, remote sessions etc. o umask=<mask> value in the /etc/login.defs file is interpreted as Octal o Setting USERGROUPS_ENAB to yes in /etc/login.defs (default): - will enable setting of the umask group bits to be the same as owner bits. (examples: 022 -> 002, 077 -> 007) for non-root users, if the uid is the same as gid, and username is the same as the <primary group name> - userdel will remove the user's group if it contains no more members, and useradd will create by default a group with the name of the user - System Wide Shell Configuration File: o /etc/profile - used to set system wide environmental variables on users shells. The variables are sometimes the same ones that are in the .bash_profile, however this file is used to set an initial PATH or PS1 for all shell users of the system. is only executed for interactive login shells, or shells executed with the --login parameter. o /etc/profile.d - /etc/profile will execute the scripts within /etc/profile.d/*.sh. It is recommended to place your configuration in a shell script within /etc/profile.d to set your own system wide environmental variables. o /etc/bashrc - System wide version of .bashrc. In Fedora derived distributions, etc/bashrc also invokes /etc/profile.d/*.sh if non-login shell, but redirects output to /dev/null if non-interactive. Is only executed for interactive shells or if BASH_ENV is set to /etc/bashrc. User Shell Configuration Files: - ~/.bash_profile - Is executed to configure your shell before the initial command prompt. Is only read by login shells. - ~/.bashrc - Is executed for interactive shells. only read by a shell that's both interactive and non-login."
    rationale: "Setting a secure default value for umask ensures that users make a conscious choice about their file permissions. A permissive umask value could result in directories or files with excessive permissions that can be read and/or written to by unauthorized users."
    remediation: "Review /etc/bashrc, /etc/profile, and all files ending in *.sh in the /etc/profile.d/ directory and remove or edit all umask entries to follow local site policy. Any remaining entries should be: umask 027, umask u=rwx,g=rx,o= or more restrictive. Configure umask in one of the following files: - A file in the /etc/profile.d/ directory ending in .sh - /etc/profile - etc/bashrc. Example: # vi /etc/profile.d/set_umask.sh umask 027. Run the following command and remove or modify the umask of any returned files: # grep -RPi '(^|^[^#]*)\\s*umask\\s+([0-7][0-7][01][0-7]\b|[0-7][0-7][0-7][0- 6]\b|[0-7][01][0-7]\b|[0-7][0-7][0- 6]\b|(u=[rwx]{0,3},)?(g=[rwx]{0,3},)?o=[rwx]+\b|(u=[rwx]{1,3},)?g=[^rx]{1,3}( ,o=[rwx]{0,3})?\b)' /etc/login.defs /etc/profile* /etc/bashrc*. Follow one of the following methods to set the default user umask: Edit /etc/login.defs and edit the UMASK and USERGROUPS_ENAB lines as follows: UMASK 027 USERGROUPS_ENAB no Edit the files /etc/pam.d/password-auth and /etc/pam.d/system-auth and add or edit the following: session optional pam_umask.so OR Configure umask in one of the following files: - A file in the /etc/profile.d/ directory ending in .sh - /etc/profile - etc/bashrc. Example: # vi /etc/profile.d/set_umask.sh umask 027 Note: this method only applies to bash and shell.

    title: "Ensure root is the only UID 0 account."
    description: "Any account with UID 0 has superuser privileges on the system."
    rationale: 'This access must be limited to only the default root account and only from the system console. Administrative access must be through an unprivileged account using an approved mechanism as noted in recommendation "Ensure access to the su command is restricted".'
    remediation: "Remove any users other than root with UID 0 or assign them a new UID if appropriate."
